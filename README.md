# go lbclient

![travis ci status](https://travis-ci.org/cloudtrust/lbclient.svg?branch=master)

The lbclient package provides implementations for client-side load-balancing for several traditional clients.
The load balancers are meant to be drop-in replacements for the regular clients.

Tests and example code can be found within this repository.

# TODO 

* Consul service discovery integration
* More load balancing policies
